The goal of this time series project is to create an ARIMA model that can forecast sticker sales. The data set is obtained from Kaggle.com and include sale data for multiple years. 

This dataset is completely synthetic, but contains many effects seen in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc.
